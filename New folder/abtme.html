						<h2>Summary</h2>
							<p align="justify">
								I am a graduate student from Stony Brook University with a master's degree in Materials Science and Engineering. 
								I am a passionate engineer by education and experience. 
								My research interest and experience fall into areas of aerospace materials and its manufacturing, stress and failure analysis of materials, and general manufacturing industry. 
								Being a materials scientist I have sound technical knowledge of thermal spray coatings, composite materials, their properties, and testing. 
								I can work through the stress analysis of materials and their failure mechanisms fluently. I have a decent background in manufacturing, designing and testing.
							</p>
						<h2>Objective</h2>
							<p align="justify">
								Materials have tremendously transformed almost every sphere of our life; be it energy, communication, transportation or sports equipment. 
								To meet the demanding needs for novel applications, such materials constantly challenge and push materials-science engineers & researchers to achieve newer heights. 
								I want to be a part of this fraternity of Materials Science engineers and contribute my might in this world in however a small way I can.

				<h3>Education</h3>
				<p align= "justify">I went through an intensive theoretical coursework of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering from The Maharaja
									Sayajirao University of Baroda.
									Eventually I developed an interest in the course and decided to pursue a master's 
									in Materials Science and Engineering from United States. The interdisciplinary coursework offered by graduate schools
									in US is very intriguing and fascinating.

				<h3>Skills</h3>
				<p align= "justify">I developed various computational skills related to stress analysis and fluid dynamics throughout my graduate life.
									In order to to be eligible in the manufacturing industry I had to keep myself at par with the skillset of mechanical engineers.
									For that I learnt many designing, 3D modeling software and also developed certain data optimizing techniques. </p>

				<h3>Experience</h3>
				<p align= "justify">During my undergrad life, I did not get much practical experience except one internship where 
									I developed an interest in manufacturing and testing of materials. However, during my graduate life I got much exposure 
									in regards to building things and the research involved behind its manufacturing. 
									The interdisciplinary work culture helped me to dive into different areas of technical expertise.</p>

				<h3>Influencers</h3>
				<p align= "justify">The most inspiring people are always the ones who live their lives without fear of othersâ€™ 
									opinions of them and make decisions that result in leaving their comfort zones to chase their goals.
									I for one am lucky, because I have people in my life that serve as an inspiration to my life, and this one is for them, 
									and everyone else who had the courage to be afraid but yet still go after the life of their dreams.
